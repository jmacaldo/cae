## Time Frame
Below is a rough breakdown on how long various stages of the development took:

* Environment setup (10 minutes)
* Getting the application to talk to the API. (30 minutes - It took a while to find a solution to get around the CORS issue. I ended up creating a proxy server to get around this issue.)
* Scaffolding (30 minutes)
* UI work - (1 hour)
* Responsive design fixes (30 minutes)
* Bug fixes (30 minutes)
* Deployment (10 minutes)

## Tech Used
This application is bootstrapped with Create-React-App. A mix of custom and Material-UI elements are used. The an Express application serves as a custom proxy back-end server that acts as the middleman between the MeetUp API and the application.
